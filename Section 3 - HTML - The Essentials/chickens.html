      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies
      of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>
      (Gallus gallus), originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first
      domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most common and
      widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept
      for their meat and eggs, though they are also kept as pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more
      than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption. Specialized
      breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and
      egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300
      eggs per year. Chickens are social animals with complex vocalizations and
      behaviors, and feature prominently in folklore, religion, and literature
      across many societies. Their economic importance makes them a central
      component of global animal husbandry and agriculture.
